        <h2>ðŸš€ Project Overview: Exoplanet Hunter</h2>
        <h3>The Mission: Finding Worlds in the Data</h3>
        <p>Our project is a machine learning solution designed to accelerate the discovery of exoplanetsâ€”worlds outside our solar system. We built a neural network that uses real astronomical data to solve a critical challenge in astrophysics: distinguishing genuine planet signals from the overwhelming cosmic "noise."</p>
        <h3>The Simple Idea: The Transit Method</h3>
        <p>When a planet passes (or "transits") in front of its host star from our perspective, the star's brightness dips slightly. This is the transit method, the most effective way to find new planets. However, not every dip in brightness is a planet. Signals are often obscured by:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>False positives: Distant binary stars or eclipsing star systems.</li>
          <li>Instrument errors: Noise from the telescope.</li>
          <li>Statistical variation: Random fluctuations in light.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Our model automates this process, sifting through millions of data points to find subtle patterns in numerical features that are nearly impossible for the human eye to spot.</p>
        <h3>What You Can Do</h3>
        <p><strong>For Beginners:</strong> Explore a real-world application of machine learning using genuine NASA Kepler data. Understand the basics of the transit method by running data through the model.</p>
        <p><strong>For Researchers:</strong> Use the model as an initial filter to quickly identify the most promising exoplanet candidates, saving valuable time and telescope resources for follow-up observations.</p>

        <h3>The Data: The Kepler Objects of Interest (KOI)</h3>
        <p>Our model is trained on the Kepler Objects of Interest (KOI) Catalog, an immense list of "suspicious" objects compiled by the Kepler Space Telescope. For years, Kepler continuously monitored thousands of stars, recording the slightest variations in their brightness. Each time the light dimmed, an entry was added to the database: a potential planet transit.</p>
        <p>However, in this cosmic lottery, not every dimming event signifies an exoplanet. The data is categorized with labels essential for our training:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Confirmed Exoplanet:</strong> A verified world.</li>
          <li><strong>Candidate:</strong> An object with transit-like features, requiring further study.</li>
          <li><strong>False Positive:</strong> An event caused by something other than an exoplanet (e.g., a background star).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each object holds a rich set of characteristicsâ€”the duration and depth of the dimming, the star's temperature, its radiusâ€”real physical parameters used by astronomers.</p>
        <p>We specifically focused on training our neural network to distinguish between Candidates and False Positives. By learning from these examples, the model is trained to recognize where a planet is truly hiding in the data versus where it's merely an optical illusion.</p>
        <h3>The Transit Method Explained</h3>
        <p>The transit method is perhaps the most elegant way to find planets beyond our system. It's based on a remarkably simple principle: If a planet crosses directly in front of its star (from an observer's perspective on Earth), the star's measured brightness drops slightly.</p>
        <p>Imagine: You're looking at a lightbulb, and a tiny speck of dust briefly passes in front of it. The light doesn't vanish, but it becomes marginally dimmer. Kepler did the same thing, but instead of dust specks, it was looking for Earth- or Jupiter-sized planets orbiting stars hundreds of light-years away.</p>
        <p><strong>How It Works:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Measurement:</strong> The telescope continuously measures the light intensity (brightness) of thousands of stars.</li>
          <li><strong>Detection:</strong> If the brightness periodically drops for the same duration and with the same depth, it's a strong indication of an orbiting planet.</li>
          <li><strong>Analysis:</strong> The exact shape of this light "dip" (called a light curve) can reveal key properties: the planet's orbital period, its size, its distance from the star, and even its approximate temperature.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Crucially, the transit method doesn't "see" planets directly; it captures their shadows. This means it only detects planets whose orbits are perfectly aligned with our line of sight, but even with this limitation, it revolutionized the field, turning exoplanets from a rarity into a statistical certainty.</p>
        <h3>ðŸ§­ Future Development</h3>
        <p>Our project's vector for future development includes two main paths:</p>
        <p><strong>Educational Enrichment:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Enhanced Visualization:</strong> Integrating more intuitive and interactive diagrams of the transit method, the light curve, and how the model interprets features.</li>
          <li><strong>Guided Learning:</strong> Creating a step-by-step tutorial section to help new users connect the raw numerical inputs to the astrophysical phenomena they represent.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Research Utility:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>New Data Integration:</strong> Expanding the model to ingest data from newer missions, such as TESS (Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite), to broaden its predictive scope.</li>
          <li><strong>Confidence Scoring:</strong> Developing a more nuanced output that provides a confidence score for candidates, rather than just a binary classification, to better guide researchers in prioritizing follow-up observations.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Our tool is designed to be an assistive technology, not a replacement for human astronomers. It helps them filter the immense haystack of data to rapidly pinpoint the few "pearls"â€”objects that truly merit closer inspection and could lead to the next famous astronomical discovery.</p>
