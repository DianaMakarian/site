    <h2>About Exoplanets</h2>
    <p>Exoplanets, or extrasolar planets, are planets that orbit stars outside our Solar System. Discovered through advanced techniques like the transit method and radial velocity, over 5,000 exoplanets have been confirmed as of 2025, with thousands more candidates awaiting verification.</p>
    <p>NASA's missions, such as Kepler and TESS, have revolutionized our understanding of these distant worlds. Our project leverages AI and machine learning to analyze NASA datasets, identifying potential exoplanets with unprecedented efficiency.</p>
    <p>From gas giants to Earth-like rocky planets, exoplanets vary widely in size, composition, and orbit. Some lie in the habitable zone, where conditions might support liquid water, raising exciting possibilities for life beyond Earth.</p>
